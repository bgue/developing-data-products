## R Markdown
This is an R Markdown document, as required in the assignment. Rather than building it from the ground up, I used the templating that RStudio provides. 

## Including Plots
The second part of the assignment is to create a map. A few of my favourite places are marked on this map.


```{r leaflet}
library(maps)
library(leaflet)

#We create a leaflet object and add a whole bunch of markers sequentially to it.  
m <- leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>%  
  addMarkers(lat=59.4, lng=24.75, popup="Talinn, the capital of Estonia") %>%
  addMarkers(lat=53.5239773,lng=-113.5131256, popup="The Sugarbowl, a fine place to stop by") %>%
  addMarkers(lat=53.1106,lng=-119.1508, popup="Mt. Robson, the highest peak in the Canadian Rockies. Well worth exploring") %>%
  addMarkers(	lat=52.2478745,lng=-117.2287932, popup="Wilcox Pass, a challenging and beautiful climb far above the treelines. Great viewlines into the glacial fields.") %>%
  addMarkers(	lat=49.52126545,lng=-124.674201877016, popup="Hornby Island, one of the most diverse places I've seen.")
m # call the leaflet object to display
```

Note that the maps library is imported but not used in the final submission. It contains coordinates for geographical features (like political boundaries).

In order to find the geo-coordinates of these locations, I used the Open Street Map location database called Nominatim. It's available at http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org  


End of submission.
